            <p>Hello! My name is Kimberly Palmer and I am from Nevada, U.S.A. I am married and have four children. I enjoy hiking with my dog and spending time with my family. I also like doing projects around my house to make it a more beautiful place to live. My husband recently taught me the basics of woodworking and it has become one of my favorite hobbies. I have built a few furniture pieces and home decor items. It has been a lot of fun.</p>
